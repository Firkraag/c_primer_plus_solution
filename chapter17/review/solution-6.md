# Problem
What is the maximum number of comparisons a sequential search and a binary search
would need to determine that a particular item is not in a sorted list of three items?
1,023 items? 65,535 items?
# Solution
For a sorted list of three items: 3 maximum comparions for sequential search, 2 for binary search.

For a sorted list of 1023 items: 1023 maximum comparions for sequential search, 10 for binary search.

For a sorted list of 65535 items: 65535 maximum comparions for sequential search, 16 for binary search.
