# Problem
Whatâ€™s an ADT?
# Solution
ADT means abstract data type. It provides abstract description of properties and operations of a data type. This description shouldn't be tied to any specific implementation or specific program language. 

Then develop a programming interface that indicate how to store the data and a set of functions to manipulate the data.

Then write code to implement the interface, especially implement the set of functions to manipulate the data.
