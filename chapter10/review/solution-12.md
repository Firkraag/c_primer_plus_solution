# Problem 
Here are three array declarations:
```
double trots[20]; 
short clops[10][30]; 
long shots[5][10][15];
```

a. Show a function prototype and a function call for a traditional `void` function that processes `trots` and also for a C function using a VLA.

b. Show a function prototype and a function call for a traditional `void` function that processes `clops` and also for a C function using a VLA.

c. Show a function prototype and a function call for a traditional `void` function that processes `shots` and also for a C function using a VLA.

# Solution
a.
