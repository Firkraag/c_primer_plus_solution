# Problem
Suppose you have this structure:
```
struct gas {
    float distance;
    float gals;
    float mpg;
};
```

a. Devise a function that takes a struct gas argument. Assume that the passed
structure contains the distance and gals information. Have the function
calculate the correct value for the mpg member and return the now completed
structure.

b. Devise a function that takes the address of a struct gas argument. Assume
that the passed structure contains the distance and gals information. Have
the function calculate the correct value for the mpg member and assign it to the
appropriate member.
# Solution
