# Problem
Mr. Noah likes counting by twos, so heâ€™s written the following program to create an array
and to fill it with the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. What, if anything, is wrong with this
program?

     #include <stdio.h>
     #define SIZE 8
     int main(void)
     {
         int by_twos[SIZE];
         int index;
         for (index = 1; index <= SIZE; index++)
            by_twos[index] = 2 * index;
         for (index = 1; index <= SIZE; index++)
            printf("%d ", by_twos);
         printf("\n");
         return 0;
     } 

# Solution


- array index start at 0
- should print array element, not the array itself
